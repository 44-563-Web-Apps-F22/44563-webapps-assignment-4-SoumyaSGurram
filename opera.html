<h3><span class="boat">BOAT.</span></h3> Aye, Little Buttercup—and well called—for you're the rosiest,the roundest, and the reddest beauty in all Spithead.<br>
    <h3><span class="but">BUT.</span></h3>  Red, am I? and round—and rosy! Maybe, for I have dissembled well!But hark ye, my merry friend—hast ever thought that beneath a
 gay and frivolous exterior there may lurk a canker-worm which is slowly but surely eating its way into one's very heart?</br>
 <h3><span class="boat">BOAT.</span></h3>  No, my lass, I can't say I've ever thought that.Enter DICK DEADEYE. He pushes through sailors, and comes down<br>
   <h3><span class="dick">DICK.</span></h3>  I have thought it often. (All recoil from him.)<br>
    <span class="but">BUT.</span> Yes, you look like it! What's the matter with the man? Isn't he well<br>
     <h3><span class="boat">BOAT.</span></h3> Don't take no heed of him; that's only poor Dick Deadeye.  
    <h3><span class="dick">DICK.</span></h3>  I say—it's a beast of a name, ain't it—Dick Deadeye?
    <h3><span class="but">BUT.</span></h3>  It's not a nice name.

    <h3><span class="dick">DICK.</span></h3> I'm ugly too, ain't I?
     <h3><span class="but">BUT.</span></h3>  You are certainly plain.
    <h3><span class="dick">DICK.</span></h3> And I'm three-cornered too, ain't I? 
     <h3><span class="but">BUT.</span></h3> You are rather triangular. 
     <p class="directions">[Roaming.....]</p>
     <h3><span class="dick">DICK.</span></h3> Ha! ha! That's it. I'm ugly, and they hate me for it; for you all hate me, don't you?
